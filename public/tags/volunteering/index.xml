      <description>The 21st edition of DebConf, DebConf20 came to end on August 29th (August 30th where I live). It officially started on August 23rd. It was my first DebConf since I started with Debian. I was looking into DebConf this year when it was scheduled for Haifa, Israel which eventually moved online due to pandemic.
I registered as soon as they opened and was surprised to find a free tier (still a student, will take paid tier as soon as I get capable :) ).</description>
