      <description>Great learnings and thoughts can arrive anytime and usually when we least expect them. One such experience happened with me yesterday (26th August 2020) during DebConf20.
I was directing a talk yesterday. In direction, my role was to choose what goes on DebConf20 live stream worldwide. During a transition, I messed up by choosing a wrong display which played on stream for more than a minute. This was only rectified when the talk meister pointed that out to me.</description>
