        <h1>Invidious Creator Steps Away From Open Source</h1><time>August 11, 2020</time></header><p>Recently <a href="https://omar.yt/">Omar Roth</a>, creator of
<a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">Invidious</a>, <a href="https://omar.yt/posts/stepping-away-from-open-source">announced</a> his stepping down from
Invidious lead developer as well as open source as a whole. He cited the mental toll and other reasons for the
same. This also result in shutting down of official Invidious instance,
<a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>. Invidious had largely been a <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/commits/master">one man
project</a> (though occasional contributions
by others were made).</p>

<p>Majority of FOSS projects usually begin as hobby project or something that solved a problem
faced by the creator. A few blows up which sometimes lead to burnouts for the
creators/developers/contributors if possible load balancing is not done.</p>

<p>As of now, <a href="https://github.com/Perflyst">Perflyst</a> (from <a href="https://snopyta.org/">Snopyta</a>) has been promoted to <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/1320#issue-671221427">project owner status</a> by Omar. Perflyst replied -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please note that I am not a developer. Therefore, I will most likely not be able to implement
breaking changes from YouTube in Invidious.</p>

<p>I will do my best to manage the issue section and to answer questions. Previous code
collaborations were also invited to the GitHub organization.</p>

<p>— <cite>Perflyst<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That leaves behind the need of contributors who could solve breakages if anything changes from
YouTube&rsquo;s side, do bug fixes and take the project forward. A major issue is that
Invidious is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)">Crystal</a>
and not many developer know or use. Though it leaves the playing field open for someone to jump in. Another thing that if it had been a
closed source software and invidio.us was the only instance, Invidious would have been lost
forever which might not be the case now as we have multiple <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/wiki/Invidious-Instances">public
instances</a> running, some
accessible via TOR hidden services too.</p>

<p><em>PS: Here’s a great
<a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/1320#issuecomment-667595476">comment</a> on the
alternatives for viewing YouTube. As of now, I would switch my Invidious embeds away from
invidio.us to probably Snopyta&rsquo;s <a href="https://invidious.snopyta.org/">instance</a>.</em></p>
