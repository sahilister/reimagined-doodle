        <h1>Don&#39;t Take Life So Seriously</h1><time>August 28, 2020</time></header><p>Great learnings and thoughts can arrive anytime and usually when we least expect them. One such experience happened with me yesterday (26th August 2020) during DebConf20.</p>

<p>I was directing a talk yesterday. In direction, my role was to choose what goes on DebConf20 live stream worldwide. During a transition, I messed up by choosing a wrong display which played on stream for more than a minute. This was only rectified when the talk meister pointed that out to me. After the talk ended, the speaker thanked us (talk meister and me) to which I apologized for messing up during his talk to which he casually said, on the lines that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take life so seriously&rdquo;. This had my mind blown. Due to the mess up, I was planning to drop from directing two other talks that I had later that day I was stressed and was getting anxious. These simple words were like enlightenment and soothed me. But after listening to the words, I dropped the idea of dropping ;).</p>

<p>I know, I&rsquo;ll mess up things in life but, I will continue doing what I enjoy and took the responsibility for. Many a time, we take life too seriously. Things tend to go haywire, mistakes happen but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to keep stressing out about it. They were experiences and happenings in our journey called life. Moving on is the key forward. Let&rsquo;s consider maybe our stresses are own creations.</p>

<p>The following quote does a fairly good job describing life:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.
― <em>Charlie Chaplin</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally,
Thank you, Florian Haftmann, speaker for talk, &ldquo;POSIX pitfalls in modern desktop environments and how to work-around them&rdquo; in DebConf20 for this lesson. I am genuinely indebted to you.</p>
