      <description>This post is inspired by Luke Smith&amp;rsquo;s blog post, &amp;ldquo;Programs and Equipment I User&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since I started making choices rather than going with what comes by default.
I plan on to write this blog every six months starting now, so a post every august and march for the foreseeable future. This will serve as my setup timeline.
Software I Use  Operating System / Distributions - I use Debian 10 Buster(stable) as of now.</description>

      <description>Great learnings and thoughts can arrive anytime and usually when we least expect them. One such experience happened with me yesterday (26th August 2020) during DebConf20.
I was directing a talk yesterday. In direction, my role was to choose what goes on DebConf20 live stream worldwide. During a transition, I messed up by choosing a wrong display which played on stream for more than a minute. This was only rectified when the talk meister pointed that out to me.</description>

      <description>I had an AWS account which offers 12 months of Amazon EC2 with 750 hours/month free on initial sign up. It&amp;rsquo;s called free tier by Amazon and offers a t2.micro instance having 1vCPU, 1 GB RAM and 30 GB of storage. I would fire up an instance now and then for trying out various services and just play around with it.
I found about YunoHost while trying to install Matrix homeserver (Synapse).</description>

      <title>Invidious Creator Steps Away From Open Source</title>

      <guid>https://blog.sahilister.tech/2020/08/invidious-creator-steps-away-from-open-source/</guid>
      <description>Recently Omar Roth, creator of Invidious, announced his stepping down from Invidious lead developer as well as open source as a whole. He cited the mental toll and other reasons for the same. This also result in shutting down of official Invidious instance, invidio.us. Invidious had largely been a one man project (though occasional contributions by others were made).
Majority of FOSS projects usually begin as hobby project or something that solved a problem faced by the creator.</description>

      <title>Privacy and Security</title>
      <link>https://blog.sahilister.tech/2020/08/privacy-and-security/</link>

      <description>Note — I&amp;rsquo;ll broadly focus on the digital/cyber side of privacy and security.
I always believed a secure system is equal to privacy respecting system. After Bryan Lunduke uploaded this and this video, they got me thinking that privacy and security are inherently two different terms. Privacy partially overlaps with security, but they many-a-times exist independently.
First let&amp;rsquo;s go over textbook definitions of the terms.
 Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, thereby express themselves selectively.</description>

Today I&amp;rsquo;m committing to working on compete. Compete is an online multiplayer typing game which I intend to work upon. Now that my college require me to submit a project, I&amp;rsquo;ll work on compete.

      <title>Invidious embed instead of Youtube&#39;s</title>

      <description>When I thought about writing my blog post titled To Zinda Ho Tum, I was dilemma. Situation being, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply copy the poem in my blog. A simple attribution wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be enough. Then I remembered about Farhan Akhar&amp;rsquo;s narration of the poem for the movie ZKMD. I thought about embedding this video along with my thoughts on it.
Now another dilemma arouse as YouTube even in it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Privacy-Enhanced mode&amp;rdquo; embed states:</description>

      <title>Firefox Monitor</title>

      <description>I have always preferred Firefox due to their approach to privacy as well as providing a viable alternative to Google backed Chromium/Chrome. Recently I also started using Thunderbird for Gmail (slowly trying to switch to ProtonMail). I couldn’t figure out why Gmail on Firefox for Linux with my extensions make the Gmail web client crawl.
Coming to Firefox Monitor. It&amp;rsquo;s an online service to see if an account has been part of any public data breach.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.sahilister.tech/2020/07/duckduckgo-bangs/</guid>
      <description>Apart from privacy centric, non-profiled search results; bangs are one of the more underrated features offered by Duckduckgo (now also available on duck.com). Bangs are shortcuts that take you to search results on other sites. Right now there&amp;rsquo;re more than 13,500 bangs available.
Syntax for bang - !bang SEARCH-TERM
Example - !w Linux , it will get you to Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s Linux entry.
 Note - Examples here assume that you’re on Duckduckgo or have it as default search engine.</description>

      <title>Alias command</title>

      <description>Writing long commands is boring. Essentially shortening the commands or chaining of commands helps. This can be achieved using alias command. Alias command is mainly used for abbreviating a system command, or for adding default arguments to a regularly used command.
Example, instead of writing:
git add . git commit -m &amp;#34;COMMIT MESSAGE&amp;#34; git push we can write following to achieve the same goals.
gc &amp;#34;COMMIT MESSAGE&amp;#34; gp  In the example, chaining of git commands has been done.</description>
