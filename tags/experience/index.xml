      <description>The 21st edition of DebConf, DebConf20 came to end on August 29th (August 30th where I live). It officially started on August 23rd. It was my first DebConf since I started with Debian. I was looking into DebConf this year when it was scheduled for Haifa, Israel which eventually moved online due to pandemic.
I registered as soon as they opened and was surprised to find a free tier (still a student, will take paid tier as soon as I get capable :) ).</description>

      <description>Note â€” I&amp;rsquo;ll broadly focus on the digital/cyber side of privacy and security.
I always believed a secure system is equal to privacy respecting system. After Bryan Lunduke uploaded this and this video, they got me thinking that privacy and security are inherently two different terms. Privacy partially overlaps with security, but they many-a-times exist independently.
First let&amp;rsquo;s go over textbook definitions of the terms.
 Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, thereby express themselves selectively.</description>
