      <description>Great learnings and thoughts can arrive anytime and usually when we least expect them. One such experience happened with me yesterday (26th August 2020) during DebConf20.
I was directing a talk yesterday. In direction, my role was to choose what goes on DebConf20 live stream worldwide. During a transition, I messed up by choosing a wrong display which played on stream for more than a minute. This was only rectified when the talk meister pointed that out to me.</description>

      <title>Invidious Creator Steps Away From Open Source</title>

      <description>Recently Omar Roth, creator of Invidious, announced his stepping down from Invidious lead developer as well as open source as a whole. He cited the mental toll and other reasons for the same. This also result in shutting down of official Invidious instance, invidio.us. Invidious had largely been a one man project (though occasional contributions by others were made).
Majority of FOSS projects usually begin as hobby project or something that solved a problem faced by the creator.</description>

      <description>When I thought about writing my blog post titled To Zinda Ho Tum, I was dilemma. Situation being, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply copy the poem in my blog. A simple attribution wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be enough. Then I remembered about Farhan Akhar&amp;rsquo;s narration of the poem for the movie ZKMD. I thought about embedding this video along with my thoughts on it.
Now another dilemma arouse as YouTube even in it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Privacy-Enhanced mode&amp;rdquo; embed states:</description>
