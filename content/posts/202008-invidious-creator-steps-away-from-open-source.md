Recently [Omar Roth](https://omar.yt/), creator of 
[Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious), [announced](https://omar.yt/posts/stepping-away-from-open-source) his stepping down from 
Invidious lead developer as well as open source as a whole. He cited the mental toll and other reasons for the 
same. This also result in shutting down of official Invidious instance, 
[invidio.us](https://invidio.us/). Invidious had largely been a [one man 
project](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/commits/master) (though occasional contributions 
by others were made).

Majority of FOSS projects usually begin as hobby project or something that solved a problem 
faced by the creator. A few blows up which sometimes lead to burnouts for the 
creators/developers/contributors if possible load balancing is not done.

As of now, [Perflyst](https://github.com/Perflyst) (from [Snopyta](https://snopyta.org/)) has been promoted to [project owner status](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/1320#issue-671221427) by Omar. Perflyst replied -

That leaves behind the need of contributors who could solve breakages if anything changes from 
YouTube's side, do bug fixes and take the project forward. A major issue is that 
Invidious is written in [Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)) 
and not many developer know or use. Though it leaves the playing field open for someone to jump in. Another thing that if it had been a 
closed source software and invidio.us was the only instance, Invidious would have been lost 
forever which might not be the case now as we have multiple [public 
instances](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/wiki/Invidious-Instances) running, some 
accessible via TOR hidden services too.

_PS: Here’s a great 
[comment](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/1320#issuecomment-667595476) on the 
alternatives for viewing YouTube. As of now, I would switch my Invidious embeds away from 
invidio.us to probably Snopyta's [instance](https://invidious.snopyta.org/)._
