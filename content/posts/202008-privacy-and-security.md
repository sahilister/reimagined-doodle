_Note — I'll broadly focus on the digital/cyber side of privacy and security._

I always believed a secure system is equal to privacy 
respecting system. After Bryan Lunduke uploaded 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn22_64UvS8) 
and 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG8Oxu7g7Gs) 
video, they got me thinking that privacy and security 
are inherently two different terms. Privacy partially 
overlaps with security, but they many-a-times exist independently.

First let's go over textbook definitions of the terms.

> **Privacy** is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, thereby express themselves selectively.

> — <cite>Wikipedia[^1]</cite>

[^1]: ["Privacy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy). _Wikipedia_.

and

> **Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

> — <cite>Cisco[^2]</cite>

[^2]: ["What is Cybersecurity?"](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html). _Cisco_. 

In my terms, privacy means when one's personal data is not seen, used or harvested without 
permission. Person is fully in control how his data is handled and it's visibility. Security is 
when the software supporting a service is secure and no third party can break in. All known 
vulnerabilities are fixed and active mitigation against any intrusion attempts are taken. Some 
example of private services are [Disroot](https://disroot.org/en), 
[Snopyta](https://snopyta.org/) amongst others. [Google](https://www.google.com/) is example of 
secure system. Services like Disroot don’t have an active security team monitoring their 
services so many a times vulnerabilities slips through (these services are less likely of 
getting attack to less ROI in compared to big services like Google which inherently gives 
them protection). Opinions vary but this is what I think. Sometimes they overlap too, like in 
case of [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) but it's less often.

Recently, I was telling a friend about the dangers of using 
[APK](.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package)s from untrusted sources of 
unknown origins. Into the conversation, he asked me what security practices should he follow. I 
advised him to get apps from Play Store only and put his trust in Google Play Security team. Though in the back of my mind, during the conversation, I had that from privacy context, non in their sane mind would 
recommend Google services.

_PS: Another takeaway from the discussion was the question 
of threat models.Maybe 
I'll write about that some other day._
