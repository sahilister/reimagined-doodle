### Thoughts and Learnings

 I slacked off, again without much progress. Though got a jitsi instance and a searx instance throught yunohost. Searx is been used as the daily driver, nice.

Let's hope the next post, which would be almost a month from the day I started has something to write in the changelog, though I doubt that too as DebConf20 is starting this weekend and will go on for a week + some sessional exams too.

### Changelog

- Nothing
