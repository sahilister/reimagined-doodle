### Thoughts and Learnings

 I slacked off the previous ten days without any activity related to web development. Though is 
recently tried [YUNO HOST](https://yunohost.org/#/) on my ec2 adding NextCloud, Element and 
trying to make my Matrix server work. I plan on to add [Searx](https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/) too but almost every time the ec2 
goes inaccessible maybe due to its same size (1 GB RAM with 8 GB storage and I guess 1 core).

Will try viewing Brad Traversy's tutorials and try implementing the base keyboard recognition 
until the next post date.

### Changelog

- Nothing
