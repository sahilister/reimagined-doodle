_Note - I broadly focus on digital side of these things of privacy and security._

I always thought a secure system is equal to privacy respecting system. After Bryan Lunduke 
uploaded [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn22_64UvS8) and 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG8Oxu7g7Gs) videos, they got me thinking that privacy 
and security are inheriently two different terms. Privacy partially overlaps with security but 
they can exist independently too.

First let's go over textbook definations of the terms.

> *Privacy* is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, thereby express themselves selectively.

and

> Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

> — <cite>Cisco[^2]</cite>

In my terms, privacy means when one's personal data is not seen, used or harvested without 
permission. Person is fully in control how his data is used and it's visibility and security is 
when the software supporting a service is secure that no third party can break in. All known 
vulnerabilities are fixed and active mitigation against any intrusion attempts. Some example of 
private services are [Disroot](https://disroot.org/en), [Snopyta](https://snopyta.org/) amongst 
others. [Google](https://www.google.com/) are example of secure systems. Sometimes they 
overlap, like in case of [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) but it's less often so.


 ervices 
like Disroot don't have a active security team monitering their services so many a times 
vulernabilities slips through(these services are less likely of getting down due to less ROI in 
compared to big services like Google which inheriently gives them protection). Opinions very 
but this is what i think.
