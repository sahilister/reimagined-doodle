Apart from privacy centric, non-profiled search results; bangs are one of the more underrated features offered by [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) (now also available on [duck.com](https://duck.com)). [Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=) are shortcuts that take you to search results on other sites. Right now there're more than 13,500 bangs available.

Syntax for bang -  _!bang_ _SEARCH-TERM_

Example - _!w Linux_ ,
it will get you to Wikipedia's Linux [entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).

> **_Note_** _- Examples here assume that youâ€™re on Duckduckgo or have it as default search engine._

Some other example are:

*   _!yt video-title_ for Youtube.
*   _!a_ for Amazon.
*   _!r_ for Reddit.

And to search for bang for your favorite site, 
 _!bang favorite-site_

If a site's bang isn't available, simply submit new bangs [here](https://duckduckgo.com/newbang).

Bangs can be used as shortcuts too. Instead of typing [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) , only typing _!yt_ would do the same. 

#### My bangs:

*   _!w_ for Wikipedia articles.
*   _!yt_ for Youtube.
*   _!ia_ for Internet Archive Wayback Machine.
*   _!nyt_ for New York Times.
*   _!mdn_ for Mozilla Developer Network.
*   _!di_ for Dictionary.com
*   _!iid_ for isitdownrightnow.com
*   _!osm_ for Open Street Maps.
*   _!translate_ for Google Translate.
