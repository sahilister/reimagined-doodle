Hi, I'm Sahil Dhiman([@sahilister](https://github.com/sahilister)) he/him.

A Computer Science undergrad, Linux / JavaScript / FOSS lover and now a blog writer ;)

Believer of liberalism. Always open to new ideas. Tries to separate identity from thoughts.
Thinks "_mind is a collection of thoughts which can be debated and replaced_".
Everyone should read "The Story of My Experiment with Truth" by Mahatma Gandhi once in their lifetime.

I write on [kudoclasm.me](https://kudoclasm.me/) with Deepshikha too.

Reach me at  `hello at sahilister dot tech` and on mastodon [here](https://fosstodon.org/@sahilister).
